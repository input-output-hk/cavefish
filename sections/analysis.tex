\section{Analysis}

\textbf{Asset and Non-Asset Compensation.} In our model, we have so far assumed that an SP performs its
services in exchange for a fee. This fee may be either flat, or calculated on the basis of transaction size,
or complexity of transaction specification, etc. - the details of this fee calculation are dependent on the
specifics of the implementation of our protocol, the marketplace, and SPs preferences.
The fee may also be specified in either an amount of primary asset tokens,
or some other user-defined tokens. A fee requirement in user-defined tokens could be useful in the case
of the SP service for LCs being associated with another type of service trading in such tokens, such as a
videogame token marketplace. Yet another option for SPs is to request non-monetary compensation
for their services, such as requiring engagement with a specific smart contract (i.e. SP does DApp fee
sponsorship), voting for a specific update,
delegating stake, etc. All these actions can be performed by the very transaction that SP constructed
according to LC's specification.
